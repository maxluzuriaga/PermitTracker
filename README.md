PermitTracker
=============

An iPhone application to track the hours driven on a learner's permit, towards the requisite number. I wrote this out of my own need, which was to track how many hours I had driven on my learner's permit, in order to track when I reached the 60 hours needed of regular driving, and the hours of night and bad weather driving.

Although I hardly think most learner's permit holders in Pennsylvania actually abide by these requirements, it was an interesting experiment in the design and coding of a utility-style iPhone app.
